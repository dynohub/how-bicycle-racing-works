Dear Outside:

The 2022 Tour de France is almost upon us, and once again it seems doomed to be all but ignored by US audiences. This is a shame because there is no sport more epic or brutal than bike racing. -- where else can you see grown men regularly bleed and/or break down in tears? Unfortunately the US seems to have lost interest in the sport since the days of domination. (That was domination by cheating, of course).

But I have long suspected the real problem is that the sport is extremely complicated. And most people -- even many of those who like to dress up in skin-tight special gear to get on their road bikes -- don't actually understand how any of it works. I think if more people understood the sport, more people would love it.

To address this, I put together a draft for an accessible graphic that introduces readers to the basics of grand-tour racing. The goal is not a comprehensive guide, but to create something that dips in a person who knows nothing about bike racing and gets their feet just wet enough to make them consider taking the plunge (to beat a metaphor). Or, alternatively, to give someone who hasn't watched any racing since the high-Lance days a quick refresher.

I think it is a good fit for Outside's accessible content, and provides a visual and unique way to engage people in this sport. It also has the potential to fit in to a larger selection of content covering the 2022 Tour and potentially other races. Or possibly content that helps people get over the barriers to participating in racing themselves. In other words, this graphic can be a part of many different larger content-creation tactics -- or just stand alone.

Please check out the attached draft. I'm open to suggestions for alternative approaches to the content (such as a vertical orientation, or a different aesthetic). I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this!

Sincerely,
Mark Torrey
