Oh sweet. Is this thread I created 20 years ago where I get to argue for how awesome bike racing is? 
</p>

<p>
Every year the Tour comes, and I start watching, and I am like "why am I going to waste so much of these beautiful summer days inside watching dudes ride slowly uphill?" And every year by the end of the first stage I'm totally hooked again.
</p>

<p>
I guess most people who watch sports (and music, let's be fair) do so in a large part because of some fantasy of <i>being</i> the athlete (or rock star). There's some kind of projection that happens, right? The American football fan wants to be the receiver pulling out the one-handed catch with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/sports/super-bowl-nfl-gloves.ht ml">sticky glove</a> (or maybe in recognition of a growing beer belly and short breath when climbing the stairs they reduce the height of their aspiration to being the gruff coach on the sideline making the hard calls). The basketball fan wants to be the guy dropping perfect half-court three-pointers. The football fan wants to be the striker doing headers into the goal, etc.
</p>

<p>
I can't get there with bike racing. God save me from <i>ever</i> having to race a bicycle. (Barring naked tallbike racing and donut racing of course.) Racing at a world-class level must be one of the most unpleasant experiences a human could inflict on themselves. Ever heard the story about Greg Lemond having diarrhea during the Tour when he was in the lead, and he just let it all go... because it's <i>The Tour</i> man. Or how in 2014 Jack Bauer broke away with one other guy at mile 0 on a stage of the Tour, and rode out front for 138 miles through the wind and rain just to be passed by the sprinters when he was within 100' of the finish line. He sat down and cried. See, it's not just physically awful, it's emotionally awful too.

I love the sport despite the bicycles, not because of them.

If what you want from sports is epic stories (and really, if that isn't what you want from sports, I don't respect you as a sports fan), then no other sport delivers like bike racing. Sure, ~180 guys in the peloton and being any particular one of those guys would probably suck -- and that's at the top level of the sport. But without fail, every year, nearly every <i>stage</i> of the grand tours delivers the edge-of-your seat nailbiting excitement that other sports only achieve when there's actually a contest and it happens to land on one of their high holy days. In cycling, (nearly) every day delivers the feels of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NN3gsSf-Ys">Prince singing Purple Rain</a> in the super bowl halftime show while it's raining.
</p>

<p>
OK, so not every day, or every race delivers a good General Contender battle. But bike racing has that thing of races-within-races. There's always <i>some</i> dude's career on the line, whether they are going for polka dots, the green jersey, or just the stage win (see Jack Bauer, again). GC is over-rated anyway. I'd rather see amateur Lucha Hererra take down Bernard Hinault on a single stage on the steepest mountains than a couple of big GC contenders duke it out for inches. (Though, yes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wteSGkudmhk">Chris Froome giving up on his bicycle</a> and running up Mont Ventoux? That fuckin' rocked.) Phil Ligget was calling the 2021 Tour the "Tour of Tears" because on so many middle-race stages the guy who won broke down crying on the finish line &mdash; not least the mighty Mark Cavendish, who worked his way to within one stage of Eddy Merckx's record for total stage wins in the Tour.
</p>

<p>
Bike racing's fatal flaw isn't doping (all sports have doping, cycling just takes it seriously), it's that it is just too damn complicated. Races-within-races is one thing, but when you sit down with the newbie to watch a race and try to explain that the dude <i>behind</i> all the others is the guy who is winning because he's not burning energy in the wind, I find I lose people quickly. Based on how many kitted up roadies I see out there speeding downhill but lazily easing their way up the climbs, it seems like even a lot of the folks wearing the roadie gear don't understand the basics of bike racing: that races are won on the climbs, that it's not about speed, it's about endurance, and being in the back is the winning position.
</p>

<p>
But if you can get your head around the basics, the grand tours deliver more epic stories in three weeks than the Olympics would if they ran for a year straight. And that right there is my argument for watching bike racing.
